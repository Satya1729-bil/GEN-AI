The system leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** in a three-step process:\n\n1. **Retrieve**: Find relevant documents using semantic search  \n2. **Rerank**: Identify the most pertinent information  \n3. **Generate**: Create coherent, accurate answers based on retrieved context\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 Problem Statement\n\nMedical professionals and patients often struggle to quickly find specific information within vast medical literature. This assistant streamlines the process by enabling:\n\n- Natural language queries about medical conditions  \n- Semantic understanding of both questions and documents  \n- Context-aware answer generation from trusted sources\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Technical Implementation\n\n### 🧾 Document Processing Pipeline\n\n```\nText Extraction → Chunking → Embedding Generation → Vector Database Indexing → Retrieval → Answer Generation\n```\n\n### 🧩 Core Components\n\n#### 1. Document Collection & Preprocessing\n- Extract text from medical PDFs using PyPDF2\n- Split documents into manageable chunks\n- Clean and normalize medical text data\n\n#### 2. Document Embeddings\n- Generate vector representations using Sentence-Transformers\n- Transform medical text into high-dimensional embeddings \n- Capture semantic relationships between medical concepts\n\n#### 3. Vector Database (FAISS)\n- Build efficient similarity search index\n- Enable sub-second query performance\n- Support for exact and approximate nearest neighbor search\n\n#### 4. Answer Generation\n- Leverage pre-trained language models (FLAN-T5)\n- Use retrieved context to generate accurate responses\n- Ensure answers are grounded in the source documents\n\n---\n\n## 📊 Sample Query & Output\n\n**Query:** \"What are the common symptoms of tuberculosis?\"  \n**System Output:**  \n- Shortness of breath  \n- Cough  \n- Chest pain  \n- Sweating  \n- Loss of appetite  \n- Fever  \n- Fatigue  \n- Muscle ache\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Fit Analysis\n\n### 🔍 Use Case & Innovation (Max 5 points)\n\n- **Use Case:** A Medical Q&A assistant that answers user queries based on uploaded medical documents  \n- **Impact:** Solves a real-world problem — making medical documents searchable and interactive using GenAI  \n- **Creativity:** While medical RAG is a known use case, our implementation is focused, practical, and clearly impactful  \n\n**✔️ Score Potential:** 4.5 / 5 (High relevance and clear application)\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Gen AI Capabilities Demonstrated\n\n| Gen AI Capability                | Used? | Notes |\n|----------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Document Understanding           | ✅    | Medical PDFs processed and parsed |\n| Embeddings                       | ✅    | SentenceTransformer used for vectorization |\n| Vector Search / RAG              | ✅    | FAISS + top-k document retrieval |\n| Retrieval Augmented Generation   | ✅    | Generated responses from relevant documents |\n| Grounding                        | ✅    | Answers are grounded in source documents |\n\n✔️ **More than 3 Gen AI capabilities used**\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Technologies Used\n\n- **Python** for core implementation  \n- **PyPDF2** for document parsing  \n- **Sentence-Transformers** for embedding generation  \n- **FAISS** for vector search  \n- **Hugging Face Transformers (FLAN-T5)** for response generation  \n- **Gradio** for interactive user interface  \n\n---\n\n## 🚀 Future Improvements\n\n- Integrate biomedical-specific embedding models  \n- Include document metadata for more context  \n- Support cross-document reasoning  \n- Enhance answer quality using medical knowledge graphs  \n- Expand document coverage\n\n---\n\n## 🙌 Acknowledgments\n\nThanks to **Google** and **Kaggle** for this amazing learning opportunity.
